# Docker Streamlit 


## Objective:
The objective of this experiment is to dockerize MySQL and set up a custom database. By using Docker, you will be able to:

Run MySQL as a containerized service, which ensures consistency across different environments.

Set up a database (student_db) inside the MySQL container.

Use Docker Compose to manage multiple containers, ensuring the MySQL service is isolated and runs efficiently.

Learn how to interact with the MySQL database from inside the container and how to initialize it with a custom SQL script (student_db.sql).

## Prerequisites:
Before proceeding with this experiment, make sure you have the following installed:

Docker:

Docker must be installed on your system to create and run containers. You can install Docker from the official site: Docker Installation Guide.


Basic Knowledge of Docker:

Familiarity with Docker commands, Docker Compose, and basic MySQL operations (like creating databases and tables) will help in understanding the process. If you're new to Docker, it's recommended to go through some basic Docker tutorials first.
